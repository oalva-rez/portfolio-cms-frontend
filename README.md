# Portfolio CMS Frontend

Welcome to the repository for my headless CMS frontend application. This React.js application is designed to provide an intuitive and efficient content management system tailored to manage portfolio content and blog posts. Its robust functionality caters to the needs of content creators and developers alike.

## Key Features
* **User API Key Generation:** Users can generate unique API keys, enabling secure and personalized access to their content.
* **Custom User Endpoints:** Create and manage custom endpoints for streamlined content delivery.
* **Project Management:** Add, edit, and delete portfolio projects with ease. Integrates AWS S3 for reliable and convenient image uploads.
* **Blog Post Management:** Craft and manage blog posts, with features to add, edit, draft, and publish. Includes SEO metadata functionality for enhanced online visibility.
* **User API Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation provided for users to effectively utilize the API, enhancing user experience and ease of use.

## How It Works

* **React.js Frontend:** Utilizes React.js for a dynamic and interactive user interface. The frontend is designed to provide a seamless user experience, facilitating easy navigation and content management.

* **Node.js Backend Integration:** The application's backend is powered by Node.js, ensuring smooth data processing and API management. This integration forms the backbone of the application's functionality.

* **User Authentication:** Implements a secure authentication system where users can sign up and log in using their email and password. This feature ensures that access to the CMS is restricted to authorized users only, safeguarding user data and content integrity.

* **AWS S3 Image Upload:** The application integrates AWS S3 for image uploading, providing a reliable and efficient solution for storing and retrieving images associated with projects and blog posts.
  
* **MongoDB Database:** All user data, including project and blog post details, are securely stored and managed in a MongoDB database. This NoSQL database choice allows for flexible data handling and scalability.
