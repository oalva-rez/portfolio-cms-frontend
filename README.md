# Headless Portfolio CMS

Welcome to the documentation for our headless portfolio CMS!

Our CMS is designed to help you manage your portfolio website easily and efficiently. With our CMS, you can update your projects and blog posts directly from the platform without needing to go through the hassle of coding and deploying changes manually. Here's a brief overview of the features of our CMS:

- **Headless architecture:** Our CMS is designed to be headless, which means that it separates the front-end presentation layer from the back-end content management layer. This allows you to use any front-end technology you want to build your website, while still being able to manage your content through our CMS.

- **Easy project and blog management:** You can add, edit, and delete projects and blog posts directly from the CMS dashboard. Our user-friendly interface makes it easy to create new projects or blog posts, and you can easily update existing ones as well.

- **Image uploads:** You can easily upload images to your projects and blog posts directly from the CMS dashboard. Our CMS supports all common image and file formats.

- **Drafts and publishing:** You can create drafts of your blog posts, so you can work on them without publishing them immediately. Once you're ready to publish, you can do so with a single click.

- **SEO optimization:** Our CMS includes built-in SEO optimization features, such as meta tags and friendly URLs, so your content is more easily discoverable by search engines.

Getting started with our CMS is easy. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Sign up for an account: You can sign up for an account on our website. Once you've created an account, you can log in to the CMS dashboard.

2. Create your first project or blog post: From the CMS dashboard, you can create your first project or blog post. You can add all the relevant information, including  images.

4. Connect your website to the API endpoint: In order to use the CMS to manage your website's content, you will need to connect your website to the CMS API endpoint using the API key. You can do this by sending HTTP requests to the endpoint with the API key in the headers.

5. Publish your content: Once you're happy with your project or blog post, you can publish it with a single click. Your content will now be visible on your website.

6. Manage your content: You can manage all your projects and blog posts from the CMS dashboard. You can edit or delete existing content, or create new content whenever you need to.

That's it! With our headless portfolio CMS, managing your portfolio website has never been easier. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our support team.
